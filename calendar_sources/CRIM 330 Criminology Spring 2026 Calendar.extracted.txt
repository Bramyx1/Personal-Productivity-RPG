CRIM 330 Criminology Spring 2026 Calendar
I reserve the right to change the dates as needed to best meet the needs of the class. Any changes will be posted in a Blackboard

To be successful in this web course, each week students should:
o Review the course calendar, BB Announcements, and/or grading notes in the BB Gradebook.
o Open the Weekly BB Folder. Complete readings, tasks, and assignments organized by week & textbook chapter
topic.
o Web students are encouraged to note the due date for quiz, discussion board, assignment, and exam in
agendas, planners, and/or electronic devices at the start of the semester. Entering dates in a phone or other
electronic reminder system can be useful to some students.
